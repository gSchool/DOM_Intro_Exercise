# DOM_Intro_Exercise

Practice manipulating the DOM!

In a separate JS file:

When the page loads:

1. Change the greeting from "Hello, There!" to "Hello, World!".

2. Set the background color of each `<li>` to `yellow`.

3. Create an image tag, set its `src` attribute to `http://49.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6qt1rjPSz1rxjzkho1_500.gif`, and append the to the `#greeting` div.

Afterwards:

4. Add the class of `selected` to an `<li>` when it is clicked. Remove it from any other `li`s as well.

5. Change the image to be the most recently clicked food item.

6. When the gray div is moused over, it's removed from the DOM.

7. When the orange div is moused over, its width doubles. When the mouse moves out of the div, it returns to its original size.

8. When the reset button is clicked - remove the `selected` class from each `<li>` and change the image to `panic.jpeg`.

9. When the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 0 key is pressed, the page alerts the message "I HATE NUMBERZZZ!"

BONUS: If someone types the [Konami Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code), the page alerts "YOU ARE AN EVENT HANDLER GURUUUUUUUUU!"
